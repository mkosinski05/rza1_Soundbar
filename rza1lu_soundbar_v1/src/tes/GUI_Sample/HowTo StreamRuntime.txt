Howto build a new separate StreamRuntime project:

1.) copy the StreamRuntime folder from your GSE delivery to an arbitrary place on the same drive. 
2.) open CMakeLists.txt from GSE/projects/cmake/ folder with CMake
3.) configure the CMake project as you are doing it for other standard GSE projects. 
4.) As a last step, enter at the entry of GSE_ROOT_PATH_STREAMRUNTIME the path to your copy of the StreamRuntime folder.

After configuring and generating the CMake project, the StreamRuntime can be built as usual.
